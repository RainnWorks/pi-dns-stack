  # Default ALSA to the HiFiBerry by card name (stable across boots — numeric
  # card IDs depend on probe order, with onboard audio at card0 and USB audio
  # at card2). The `softvol` layer in front of the hardware bounds the dB
  # range so apps see a slider that's actually usable across its full travel:
  #
  #   slider 0%  → -45 dB (very quiet but audible)
  #   slider 50% → softvol log-mapped (rough background-music level)
  #   slider 100% → -10 dB (loud, not ear-melting)
  #
  # The PCM5121's Digital control alone has the *full* hardware range
  # (-103.5 dB to 0 dB), which on this amp+speaker combo gives a slider where
  # most of the useful range is squashed into a few percentage points at one
  # end — either way you cut it (linear or log curve). HiFiBerryOS uses this
  # same softvol pattern; we replicate it. Tweak min_dB / max_dB if your
  # speakers + listening environment want a different window.
